# This project's Typescript types and interfaces rules

Be concise for every single typescript type. NEVER EVER use `any` in our code.

Rules of engagement:

1. Top priority: Look for the relevant type generate by Prisma client that's based on the database schema.
2. Only use custom types or interfaces when it doesnt relate to the schema or a libraries own inherant types. NEVER override them.
